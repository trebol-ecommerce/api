## Specification

Below is a short summary of available paths and their purposes. Unless stated otherwise, they all impose the need of a Bearer token for authorization.

### `/access` - Allowed privileges for the API consumer

- `/` - Lists all paths in `/data` that the API consumer has any level of access to
- `/{resource}` - Lists allowed CRUD operations on a given resource. Can contain any combination of these four: `create`, `read`, `update` and `delete`

### `/account` - Resources for the API consumer and their user account

- `/profile` - Fetch or update existing personal and contact information

### `/data` - CRUD operations

- `/billing_types` - [Public] Options for generating bill receipts
- `/customers` - Correlation of stored personal information towards clients that have actually requested to purchase through the store
- `/images` - Metadata of photos and pictures uploaded and served through any internal and/or external web service, assumed to be accesible from the internet
- `/people` - Stored contact and/or personal information about real-life individuals
- `/products` - [Public] The items that the store displays to the public and makes available for purchase. Includes products not available for purchase
- `/product_categories` - [Public] Tree-like schema of organization for products
- `/product_lists` - [Public] Named groups used to organize and link specific products together
- `/product_list_contents` - [Public] Pagination of products contained on given lists
- `/sales` - The purchases acknowledged through the store; they follow a certain transaction flow; updating their state to `requested`, `paid`, `cancelled`, `failed`, `delivered`, among others
- `/salespeople` - Correlation of stored personal information towards employees that earn sales through the store
- `/shippers` - [Public] Metadata of internal and/or external logistics services for shipping and delivery of physical items
- `/user_roles` - Metadata of available privilege groupings for users
- `/users` - Metadata of available accounts to access API resources

### `/public` - API resources that may not require auth

- `/about` - Metadata about the store and their respective owners
- `/checkout` - [Auth required] Transaction request; where consumers submit a cart with products and receive details to be redirected to the payment page.
  - `/validate` - Endpoint of return from payment page. Must redirect to a result page served through the corresponding frontend of the store.
- `/guest` - Request a short-lived token that can be used for calls to `/checkout`
- `/login` - Request for authentication with an existing user account, and generation + fetching of new auth token
- `/products` - Similar to `/data/products`
- `/receipt/{code}` - Metadata for a specific `Sell`. The `code` variable must identify only one transaction, but its exact meaning can vary
- `/register` - Request for creation of a new user account
